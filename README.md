MarioCard is like MarioKart, but with Post-It notes on the floor and physical bots instead of virtual tokens on the ground. We're building the bots with Teensy boards on a 3 wheeled bot chassis with a WiFly shield to connect all of the bots to a central server. 'How do you control the phone?' you ask? With your phone of course! We'll show you schematics and other fun as we go.

The schematic is available in a Fritzing file, if you don't know what Fritzing is check it out here: http://fritzing.org/ 

You can find the WiFly library here:
